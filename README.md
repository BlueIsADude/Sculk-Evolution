Sculk Evolution is a mod that simply adds more content to the Deep Dark. It mainly adds a new unique weapon known as the Sickle, and a new Vault variant.

NOTE: This mod will NOT be adding a new dimension. All content in the mod will be exclusively found in the deep dark and ancient cities.

<summary>Current Features (as of v1.0.0)</summary>

## Umbra Vault
The Umbra Vault is a new vault variant that, when opened with a Warden Key (found in Ancient City chests), will dispense a larger amount of loot compared to regular Vaults, and can be reopened as often as possible. Whenever it is opened however, it will summon a Warden nearby (disabled on peaceful, or when the warden spawning gamerule is disabled).

## Ancient Altar
Ancient Altars are a new miniature structure found in the Deep Dark. They are relatively small, but they're the only place you will be able to find Umbra Vaults, which will be directly in the middle of the structure.

## Bladed Hook
The Bladed Hook is a decorational block found in Umbra Vaults. It behaves similarly to lanterns, being able to place them on floors and ceilings. They pair especially well with chains.

## Sickle
The Sickle is a new weapon crafted using a Bladed Hook, a Bone, and an Echo Shard. The sickle has the same stats as an iron hoe and has a sweeping attack. What makes the Sickle unique though is its "combo system". Basically, when you hit a living mob, the sickle gains 1 attack damage. It caps out at 10 attack damage, and every 3 attacks will cause sculk to grow on the blade until the damage cap is reached. When the user takes damage however, the sculk dissipates and the attack damage is reset. When the Sickle is on cooldown, its bonus attack damage is reduced by 1/4th.

## Sickle Enchantments
Echo Chamber: Only has 1 level, and can only be found in Umbra Vaults. Holding down right click while the sickle has sculk on it will charge and release a sonic boom, damaging the sickle and resetting its damage. The sonic boom shares attack damage with the sickle, and increases in range but also cooldown and durability loss the more sculk is on the blade when used.

Soul Lunge: Only has 1 level, and can only be found in Umbra Vaults. Right-clicking while the sickle has sculk on it will cause the user to dash, reducing the sickles damage by 3. The dash deals no damage.

Hemostasis: Only has 1 level, and can only be found in Umbra Vaults. When right-clicking while the sickle has sculk, you will heal 4 health and reduce the sickles damage by 3.

Repulse: Only has 1 level, and can only be found in Umbra Vaults. It is compatable with the other Sickle enchantments. It retains a large amount of sculk when hit, at the cost of a cooldown. It also buffs Echo Chamber, allowing it to retain sculk, at the cost of a longer cooldown.

<summary>Planned Features</summary>

Note: Features listed here are subject to change, and might not be in the final mod.

## Budding Sculk Catalyst + Echomites
The Budding Sculk Catalyst is crafted with a Sculk Catalyst and 4 Echo Shards surrounding it. Instead of spreading sculk when a mob dies, it will instead slowly grow Echo Shards on top of itself, growing by 1 level every time a mob is slain. If the echo shards are fully grown, it will instead spawn an Echomite, a slower but more dangerous version of the Silverfish. Echomites will also have a chance to spawn when breaking the fully grown echo shards.
