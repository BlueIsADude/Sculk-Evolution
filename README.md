Sculk Evolution is a mod that adds more uses to sculk and echo shards! Currently, it only adds 2 new items and 3 new enchantments, but it will eventually add more.

<summary>Current Features</summary>

## Bladed Hook
The Bladed Hook is a decorational block which can rarely be found in deep dark ice box chests. It behaves similarly to lanterns, being able to place them on floors and ceilings. They pair especially well with chains.

## Sickle
The Sickle is a new weapon crafted using a Bladed Hook, a Bone, and an Echo Shard. The sickle has the same stats as an iron hoe and has a sweeping attack. What makes the Sickle unique though is its "combo system". Basically, when you hit a living mob, the sickle gains 1 attack damage. It caps out at 10 attack damage, and every  3 attacks will cause sculk to grow on the blade until the damage cap is reached. When the user takes damage however, the sculk dissipates and the attack damage is reset.

## Sickle Enchantments
Echo Chamber: Only has 1 level, and currently can only be found in enchantment tables. Holding down right click while the sickle has sculk on it will charge and release a sonic boom, damaging the sickle and resetting its damage. The sonic boom shares attack damage with the sickle, and increases in range but also cooldown and durability loss the more sculk is on the blade when used.
Repulse: Only has 1 level, and currently can only be found in enchantment tables. Taking damage while the sickle has sculk on it will release a tiny sonic boom, dealing 4 damage and pushing attackers back. The sonic boom's knockback increases as the sickle gains attack damage, but will enter cooldown when the user is attacked.
Soul Lunge: Only has 1 level, and currently can only be found in enchantment tables. Right-clicking while the sickle has sculk on it will cause the user to dash, reducing the sickles damage by 3. The dash deals no damage.

<summary>Planned Features</summary>

Note: Features listed here are subject to change, and might not be in the final mod.

## Vanilla Changes
Umbra Keys will be added to Ancient City chests, and may also be added to the Warden's loot on death.

## Feature Changes
The Bladed Hook may gain the ability to store a stack of any food item, being able to display it on the hook. It will also be removed from ice box chests, and instead be moved to the Umbra Vault.
All 3 sickle enchantments will also be moved from the enchantment table to the Umbra Vault.

## Umbra Vault
The Umbra Vault is a new block very similar to both the vaults and the spawners in trial chambers, but uses Umbra Keys instead of Trial Keys. When a key is used on the vault, instead of dispensing items right away, it will spawn a few sculk-themed enemies around itself. When they're all slain, it will then proceed to dispense the items and become permanently unusable for the player that used the key, identically to regular vaults.

## Altars
Altars are a new structure found in the Deep Dark. They are relatively small, being comparable to desert wells, but they're the only place you will be able to find Umbra Vaults, which will be directly in the middle of the structure. They may also have Suspicious Sculk around them, which behaves identically to suspicious sand and gravel.

## Budding Sculk Catalyst
The Budding Sculk Catalyst is crafted with a Sculk Catalyst and 4 Echo Shards surrounding it. Instead of spreading sculk when a mob dies, it will instead slowly grow Echo Shards on top of itself, growing by 1 level every time a mob is slain. If the echo shards are fully grown, it will stop absorbing mob xp.
